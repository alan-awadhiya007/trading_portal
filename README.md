# 📊 Stock Trading Web Portal

This project is a **Stock Trading Web Portal** where users can perform Buy and Sell operations with stocks using **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** and **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** methods.  
The backend is powered by **Node.js** with **MongoDB**, and the frontend provides a demo interface to interact with the trading system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alan-awadhiya007/trading_portal.git
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install all required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
cd stock-trading-web-portal
npm install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```env
DATABASE="mongodb://localhost:27017/stock_trading"
MS_TRADE_PORTAL_HOST=0.0.0.0
MS_TRADE_PORTAL_PORT=9000
```

- **DATABASE:** MongoDB connection string  
- **MS_TRADE_PORTAL_PORT:** Port number for running the server  

---

### 4️⃣ Start the Node.js Application

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Node.js server on `http://localhost:9000` (or the port defined in `.env`).

### 5️⃣ View the Demo

After starting the server:  

1. Navigate to the `view` folder.  
2. Open the `demo.html` file directly in your browser.  

This file demonstrates the Buy/Sell trade functionality with **FIFO** and **LIFO** sell types.
